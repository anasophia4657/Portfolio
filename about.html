                Hi! My name is Ana Sophia, and I'm a junior designer. I grew up just <br>
                outside of Washington D.C. with my parents, who immigrated from<br>
                Portugal.  Growing up and being surrounded by so many different<br>
                cultures sparked my curiosity and gave me a strong desire to explore.<br> 
                Living in an urban environment also helped me develop a deep<br>
                 appreciation for art and design. Once I realized I could actually pursue it,<br> 
                I dove in and have not looked back since.<br> 
                <br> <br>
                After finishing high school in the U.S., I had to face the big question that<br>
                everyone eventually does: Whats next? Thankfully, it wasnt as scary of a<br>
                question for me. I knew I wanted to be a creative, and I also felt a strong<br>
                pull to return to my home country. Going back to Portugal was important<br>
                because, although I experienced many cultures growing up in the U.S., I <br>
                wanted to reconnect with my own culture while still in the process of<br>
                discovering who I am.
                <br> <br>
                That is how I found my way to IADE Creative University, right in the heart<br>
                of Lisbon. IADE is ranked in the top 50 design schools in Europe by the<br>
                Domus Ranking. The school gave me many real-world experiences in<br>
                design which im very grateful for! Thanks to these experiences and<br>
                lessons that are so applicable to the real world, I have never felt more<br>
                empowered in my education, and confident in my skills than I do now.
